# Realtime

## Tuning Realtime Performance

See the section on [Ingesting Realtime Data](https://pinot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture.html#ingesting-realtime-data) before reading this section.

Pinot servers ingest rows into a consuming segment that resides in volatile memory. Therefore, pinot servers hosting consuming segments tend to be memory bound. They may also have long garbage collection cycles when the segment is completed and memory is released.

### Controlling memory allocation

You can configure pinot servers to use off-heap memory for dictionary and forward indices of consuming segments by setting the value of `pinot.server.instance.realtime.alloc.offheap` to `true`. With this configuration in place, the server allocates off-heap memory by memory-mapping files. These files are never flushed to stable storage by Pinot \(the Operating System may do so depending on demand for memory on the host\). The files are discarded when the consuming segment is turned into a completed segment.

By default the files are created under the directory where the tableâ€™s segments are stored in local disk attached to the consuming server. You can set a specific directory for consuming segments with the configuration `pinot.server.consumerDir`. Given that there is no control over flushing of pages from the memory mapped for consuming segments, you may want to set the directory to point to a memory-based file system, eliminating wasteful disk I/O.

If memory-mapping is not desirable, you can set `pinot.server.instance.realtime.alloc.offheap.direct` to `true`. In this case, pinot allocates direct [ByteBuffer](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html) objects for consuming segments. Using direct allocation can potentially result in address space fragmentation.

Note

We still use heap memory to store inverted indices for consuming segments.

### Controlling number of rows in consuming segment

The number of rows in a consuming segment needs to be balanced. Having too many rows can result in memory pressure. On the other hand, having too few rows results in having too many small segments. Having too many segments can be detrimental to query performance, and also increase pressure on the Helix.

The recommended way to do this is to use the `realtime.segment.flush.desired.size` setting as described in [StreamConfigs Section](https://pinot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tableconfig_schema.html#stream-config-description). You can run the administrative tool `pinot-admin.sh RealtimeProvisioningHelper` that will help you to come up with an optimal setting for the segment size.

### Moving completed segments to different hosts

This feature is available only if the consumption type is `LowLevel`.

The structure of the consuming segments and the completed segments are very different. The memory, CPU, I/O and GC characteristics could be very different while processing queries on these segments. Therefore it may be useful to move the completed segments onto different set of hosts in some use cases.

You can host completed segments on a different set of hosts using the `tagOverrideConfig` as described in [Table Config](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/components/table#tenants). Pinot will automatically move them once the consuming segments are completed.

### Controlling segment build vs segment download on Realtime servers

This feature is available only if the consumption type is `LowLevel`.

When a realtime segment completes, a winner server is chosen as a committer amongst all replicas by the controller. That committer builds the segment and uploads to the controller. The non-committer servers are asked to catchup to the winning offset. If the non-committer servers are able to catch up, they are asked to build the segment and replace the in-memory segment. If they are unable to catchup, they are asked to download the segment from the controller.

Building a segment can cause excessive garbage and may result in GC pauses on the server. Long GC pauses can affect query processing. In order to avoid this, we have a configuration that allows you to control whether

It might become desirable to force the non-committer servers to download the segment from the controller, instead of building it again. The `completionConfig` as described in [Table Config](https://pinot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tableconfig_schema.html#table-config-section) can be used to configure this.

### Fine tuning the segment commit protocol

This feature is available only if the consumption type is `LowLevel`.

Once a committer is asked to commit the segment, it builds a segment, and issues an HTTP POST to the controller, with the segment. The controller than commits the segment in Zookeeper and starts the next consuming segment.

It is possible to conifigure the servers to do a _split_ commit, in which the committer performs the following steps:

> * Build the segment
> * Start a transaction with the lead controller to commit the segment \(CommitStart phase\)
> * Post the completed segment to any of the controllers \(and the controller posts it to segment store\)
> * End the transaction with the lead controller \(CommentEnd phase\). Optionally, this step can be done _with_ the segment metadata.

This method of committing can be useful if the network bandwidth on the lead controller is limiting segment uploads.In order to accomplish this, you will need to set the following configurations:

* On the controller, set `pinot.controller.enable.split.commit` to `true` \(default is `false`\).
* On the server, set `pinot.server.enable.split.commit` to `true` \(default is `false`\).
* On the server, set `pinot.server.enable.commitend.metadata` to `true` \(default is false\).

### RealtimeProvisioningHelper

This tool can help decide the optimum segment size and number of hosts for your table. You will need one sample Pinot segment from your table before you run this command. If you have an offline segment, you can use that. Alternatively, you can provision a test version of your table with some minimum number of hosts that can consume the stream, let it create a few segments with large enough number of rows \(say, 500k  to 1M rows\), and use one of those  segments to run the command. You can drop the test version table, and re-provision it once the command outputs some parameters to set.

The arguments for this command are as follows \(some of these have default values, so try the -help argument first\):

* `tableConfigFile`: This is the path to the table config file
* `numPartitions`: Number of partitions in your stream
* `numHosts`: This is a list of the number of hosts for which you need to compute the actual parameters. For example,  if you are planning to deploy between 4 and 8 hosts, you may specify 4,6,8. In this case, the parameters will be computed for each configuration -- that of 4 hosts, 6 hosts, and 8 hosts. You can then decide which of these configurations to use.
* `sampleCompletedSegmentDir`: The path of the directory in which the sample segment is present.
* `periodSampleSegmentConsumed`: The time taken for the sample segment to be consumed. If it is an offline segment, then you will need to compute this value by dividing the number of rows in the offline segment by the average ingestion rate of any one partition in your stream \(we assume here that the partitions are more or less uniform\).
* `maxUsableHostMemory`: This is the total memory available in each host for hosting segments of this table. Remember to leave some for query processing \(or other tables,  if you have them in the same hosts\)

Once you run the command, it produces an out like below:

```

Now, depending on how much memory you want to allocate for this table, and how many hosts you want to provision, you can select the number of hours to consume, and the optimal segment size, and enter that into the streamsConfig section of the table configuration.
