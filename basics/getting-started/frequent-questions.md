### Do replica groups work for real-time? <a id="docs-internal-guid-3eddb872-7fff-0e2a-b4e3-b1b43454add3"></a>

Yes, replica groups work implicitly for realtime. There is no config needed. All you have to do is ensure the number of servers is a multiple of numReplicas. The partitions get uniformly sprayed across the servers, creating replica groups.  
  
For example, consider we have 6 partitions, 2 replicas, and 4 servers.

|  | r1 | r2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| p1 | S0 | S1 |
| p2 | S2 | S3 |
| p3 | S0 | S1 |
| p4 | S2 | S3 |
| p5 | S0 | S1 |
| p6 | S2 | S3 |

As you can see, the set \(S0, S2\) contains r1 of every partition, and \(s1, S3\) contains r2 of every partition. The query will only be routed to one of the sets, and not span every server.



### How to apply inverted index to existing setup?

1. Add the columns you wish to index to the tableIndexConfig-&gt; invertedIndexColumns list. This sample table config show inverted indexes set: [https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/components/table\#offline-table-config ](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/components/table#offline-table-config)To update the table config use the Pinot Swagger API: [http://localhost:9000/help\#!/Table/updateTableConfig](http://localhost:9000/help#!/Table/updateTableConfig)
2. Invoke the reload API: [http://localhost:9000/help\#!/Segment/reloadAllSegments](http://localhost:9000/help#!/Segment/reloadAllSegments)

Right now, thereâ€™s no easy way to confirm that reload succeeded. One way it to check out the index\_map file inside the segment metadata, you should see inverted index entries for the new columns. An API for this is coming soon: [https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/issues/5390](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/issues/5390)
