# Batch Data Ingestion Using S3 as Deep Store

{% hint style="info" %}
Below commands are based on pinot distribution binary.
{% endhint %}

## Setup Pinot Cluster

In order to setup Pinot to use S3 as deep store, we need to put extra configs for Controller and Server.

### Start Controller

Below is a sample `controller.conf` file.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please config `controller.data.dir`to your s3 bucket. All the uploaded segments will be stored there. 
{% endhint %}

```bash
controller.data.dir=s3://my.bucket/pinot-data/pinot-s3-example/controller-data
controller.local.temp.dir=/tmp/pinot-tmp-data/
controller.zk.str=localhost:2181
controller.host=127.0.0.1
controller.port=9000
controller.helix.cluster.name=pinot-s3-example
pinot.controller.storage.factory.class.s3=org.apache.pinot.plugin.filesystem.S3PinotFS
pinot.controller.storage.factory.s3.region=us-west-2

pinot.controller.segment.fetcher.protocols=file,http,s3
pinot.controller.segment.fetcher.s3.class=org.apache.pinot.common.utils.fetcher.PinotFSSegmentFetcher
```

Then start pinot controller with:

```
bin/pinot-admin.sh StartController -configFileName conf/controller.conf
```

### Start Broker

Broker is a simple one you can just start it with default:

```
bin/pinot-admin.sh StartBroker -zkAddress localhost:2181 -clusterName pinot-s3-example
```

### Start Server

Below is a sample `server.conf` file

```bash
pinot.server.netty.port=8098
pinot.server.adminapi.port=8097
pinot.server.instance.dataDir=/tmp/pinot-tmp/server/index
pinot.server.instance.segmentTarDir=/tmp/pinot-tmp/server/segmentTars


pinot.server.storage.factory.class.s3=org.apache.pinot.plugin.filesystem.S3PinotFS
pinot.server.storage.factory.s3.region=us-west-2
pinot.server.segment.fetcher.protocols=file,http,s3
pinot.server.segment.fetcher.s3.class=org.apache.pinot.common.utils.fetcher.PinotFSSegmentFetcher
```

Then start pinot controller with:

```
bin/pinot-admin.sh StartServer -configFileName conf/server.conf -zkAddress localhost:2181 -clusterName pinot-s3-example
```

## Setup Table

In this demo, we just use `airlineStats` table as an example.

Create table with below command:

```text
bin/pinot-admin.sh AddTable  -schemaFile examples/batch/airlineStats/airlineStats_schema.json -tableConfigFile examples/batch/airlineStats/airlineStats_offline_table_config.json -exec
```

## Set up Ingestion Jobs

### Standalone Job

Below is a sample standalone ingestion job spec with certain notable changes:

* **jobType** is **SegmentCreationAndUriPush**
* **inputDirURI** is set to a s3 location  **s3://my.bucket/batch/airlineStats/rawdata/**
* **outputDirURI** is set to a s3 location  **s3://my.bucket/output/airlineStats/segments**
* Add a new PinotFs under **pinotFSSpecs**

  ```text
  - scheme: s3
    className: org.apache.pinot.plugin.filesystem.S3PinotFS
    configs:
      region: 'us-west-2'
      accessKey: '****************LFVX'
      secretKey: '****************gfhz'
  ```

* For library version &lt; **0.6.0**, please set `segmentUriPrefix` to `[scheme]://[bucket.name]`, e.g. `s3://my.bucket` , from version **0.6.0**, you can put empty string or just ignore `segmentUriPrefix`.

Sample `ingestionJobSpec.yaml`
