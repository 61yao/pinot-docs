# External Clients

A lot of times the user wants to query data from an external application instead of using the inbuilt query explorer. Pinot provides external query client for this purpose.  
  
All of the clients have pretty standard interfaces so that the learning curve is minimum.

Currently Pinot provides the following clients

{% page-ref page="jdbc.md" %}

{% page-ref page="java.md" %}

{% page-ref page="python.md" %}

{% page-ref page="golang.md" %}
