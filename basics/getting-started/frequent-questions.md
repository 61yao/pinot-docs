### Do replica groups work for real-time? <a id="docs-internal-guid-3eddb872-7fff-0e2a-b4e3-b1b43454add3"></a>

Yes, replica groups work implicitly for realtime. There is no config needed. All you have to do is ensure the number of servers is a multiple of numReplicas. The partitions get uniformly sprayed across the servers, creating replica groups.  
  
For example, consider we have 6 partitions, 2 replicas, and 4 servers.

|  | r1 | r2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| p1 | S0 | S1 |
| p2 | S2 | S3 |
| p3 | S0 | S1 |
| p4 | S2 | S3 |
| p5 | S0 | S1 |
| p6 | S2 | S3 |

As you can see, the set \(S0, S2\) contains r1 of every partition, and \(s1, S3\) contains r2 of every partition. The query will only be routed to one of the sets, and not span every server.

### How to set inverted indexes?

Inverted indexes are set in the tableConfig's tableIndexConfig -&gt; invertedIndexColumns list. Here's the documentation for tableIndexConfig: [https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/components/table\#tableindexconfig-1](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/components/table#tableindexconfig-1) along with a sample table that has set inverted indexes on some columns.

### How to apply inverted index to existing setup?

1. Add the columns you wish to index to the tableIndexConfig-&gt; invertedIndexColumns list. This sample table config show inverted indexes set: [https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/components/table\#offline-table-config ](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/components/table#offline-table-config)To update the table config use the Pinot Swagger API: [http://localhost:9000/help\#!/Table/updateTableConfig](http://localhost:9000/help#!/Table/updateTableConfig)
2. Invoke the reload API: [http://localhost:9000/help\#!/Segment/reloadAllSegments](http://localhost:9000/help#!/Segment/reloadAllSegments)

Right now, thereâ€™s no easy way to confirm that reload succeeded. One way it to check out the index\_map file inside the segment metadata, you should see inverted index entries for the new columns. An API for this is coming soon: [https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/issues/5390](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/issues/5390)

### How to apply star tree index?

### How do I flatten my JSON Kafka stream?

We have `toJsonStr(key)` function which can store a top level json field as a STRING in Pinot.

Then you can use `jsonExtractScalar(JSON_STRING_FIELD, JSON_PATH, OUTPUT_FORMAT)` function during query time to fetch the desired field from the json string. For example

```text
Select jsonExtractScalar(myJsonMapStr,'$.k1','STRING') 
    from myTable  
    where jsonExtractScalar(myJsonMapStr,'$.k1','STRING') = 'value-k1-0'"
```

```text
Select sum(jsonExtractScalar(complexMapStr,'$.k4.met','INT')) 
    from myTable 
    group by jsonExtractScalar(complexMapStr,'$.k1','STRING')
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**NOTE**  
This works well if some of your fields are nested json, but most of your fields are top level json keys. If all of your fields are within a nested JSON key, you will have to store the entire payload as 1 column, which is not ideal.  
  
Support for flattening during ingestion is on the roadmap: [https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/issues/5264](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/issues/5264)

### What are all the fields in the Pinot query's JSON response?

Here's the page explaining the Pinot response format: [https://docs.pinot.apache.org/users/api/querying-pinot-using-standard-sql/response-format](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/users/api/querying-pinot-using-standard-sql/response-format)

### SQL Query fails with "Encountered 'timestamp' was expecting one of..."

"timestamp" is a reserved keyword in SQL. Escape timestamp with double quotes. TODO: link to full list of reserved keywords

```text
select "timestamp" from myTable
```
