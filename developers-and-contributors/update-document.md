# Update Document

Pinot documentation is backed up by Gitbook. It has a github repo\([https://github.com/pinot-contrib/pinot-docs](https://github.com/pinot-contrib/pinot-docs)\) to back up all the changes.

There are two ways to update the documentations.

1. Submit a PullRequest.

Since Gitbook documentation is backed up by the Github repo, we can edit the content by submitting a PullRequest.

Please note that the documentation follows [Markdown Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

2. Directly working on Gitbook.

Please contact admin\(Email to [dev@pinot.apache.org](mailto:dev@pinot.apache.org) with the content you wanna add\) to ask for edit permission for Pinot gitbook.
