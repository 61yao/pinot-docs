## Special notes

* Pinot controller metrics prefix is fixed to add a missing dot \([\#6499](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/6499)\). This is a backward-incompatible change that JMX query on controller metrics must be updated
* Legacy group key delimiter \(\t\) was removed to be backward-compatible with release 0.5.0 \([\#6589](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/6589)\)
* Upgrade zookeeper version to 3.5.8 to fix ZOOKEEPER-2184: Zookeeper Client should re-resolve hosts when connection attempts fail. \([\#6558](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/6558)\)
* Add TLS-support for client-pinot and pinot-internode connections \([\#6418](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/6418)\) Upgrades to a TLS-enabled cluster can be performed safely and without downtime. To achieve a live-upgrade, go through the following steps:
  * First, configure alternate ingress ports for https/netty-tls on brokers, controllers, and servers. Restart the components with a rolling strategy to avoid cluster downtime.
  * Second, verify manually that https access to controllers and brokers is live. Then, configure all components to prefer TLS-enabled connections \(while still allowing unsecured access\). Restart the individual components.
  * Third, disable insecure connections via configuration. You may also have to set controller.vip.protocol and controller.vip.port and update the configuration files of any ingestion jobs. Restart components a final time and verify that insecure ingress via http is not available anymore.
* PQL endpoint on Broker is deprecated \([\#6607](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/6607)\)
  * Apache Pinot has adopted SQL syntax and semantics. Legacy PQL \(Pinot Query Language\) is deprecated and no longer supported. Please use SQL syntax to query Pinot on broker endpoint /query/sql and controller endpoint /sql
