# Deployment and Monitoring

There are multiple different sections in the documentation to help you get started with operating a Pinot cluster. If you are new to Pinot, please start with the basics.

{% page-ref page="../../basics/concepts.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../../basics/architecture.md" %}

To get started with operating a Pinot cluster, first please look at the tutorials in [Getting Started](../../basics/getting-started/) on how to run a basic pinot cluster in various environments.

{% page-ref page="../../basics/getting-started/running-pinot-locally.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../../basics/getting-started/kubernetes-quickstart.md" %}

You can then proceed to the more advanced Pinot setup in production environment.
