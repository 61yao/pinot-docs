# Releases

## Note

Before upgrading from one version to another one, please read the release notes. While the Pinot committers strive to
keep releases backaward-compatible and introduce new features in a compatible manner, your environment
may have a unique combination of configurations/data/schema that may have been somehow overlooked. Before you roll out a
new release of Pinot on your cluster, it is best that you run
the [compatibility test suite](../../operators/operating-pinot/upgrading-pinot-cluster.md) that Pinot provides. The 
tests can be easily customized to suit the configurations and tables in your pinot cluster(s).
As a good practice, you should build your own test suite, mirroring the table configurations, schema, sample data
and queries that is used in your cluster.
