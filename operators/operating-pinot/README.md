There are multiple different sections in the documentation to help you get started with operating a Pinot cluster. If you are new to Pinot, please start with the basics.

{% page-ref page="../../basics/architecture.md" %}

To get started with operating a Pinot cluster, first please look at the tutorials in [Getting Started](../../basics/getting-started/) on how to run a basic pinot cluster in various environments.

You can then proceed to the more advanced Pinot setup in production environment.
